Technical challenge for ubc launchpad 2022
The responsive design can be implemented in two ways
1) Bootstrap Grid:
One way we can use is the bootstrap grid option depending on the components of the website. 
We can set up the amount of rows visible in a particular size by using the "row" class and "col-m / col-sm" abilities of the CSS grid.
This we way can decide the amount of information to be shown in mobile size.

2) CSS media view:
The other way we can implement this is by using the CSS "@media query".
We can set up max-width/min-width as the maximum and minimum resolutions where we want to set a breakpoint where the view changes to fit the resolution.
For example, In my css_implementation file, if 1334px is the maximum resolution of the deviceâ€™s screen, then the background color would be black.
